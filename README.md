# Master’s Thesis: Machine Learning in Materials Science  
**Predicting molecular properties using sequence-based methods**  
*Defended on: June 2025*

---

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and supporting material for my master’s thesis in Engineering Physics. The thesis explores the use of neural network architectures (GRU, LSTM, Transformer) to predict molecular properties such as HOMO–LUMO gaps from SMILES representations.
